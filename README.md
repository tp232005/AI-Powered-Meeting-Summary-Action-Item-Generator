🚀 AI-Powered Meeting Summary & Action Item Generator

Meetings generate ideas. They also generate confusion.

This project is an intelligent NLP-driven system that transforms raw meeting transcripts into structured, actionable insights within seconds. Instead of manually reviewing lengthy discussions, the application automatically produces concise summaries and extracts clear action items — highlighting who needs to do what and when.

Powered by transformer-based language models and entity-aware task extraction, the system combines speech-to-text processing, contextual summarization, and rule-guided decision logic to ensure both accuracy and relevance. The goal is simple: eliminate post-meeting ambiguity and dramatically improve productivity.

Whether used in academic collaborations, corporate stand-ups, or remote team discussions, this system ensures that no key decision or responsibility gets lost in conversation.
